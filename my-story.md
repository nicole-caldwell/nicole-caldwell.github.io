# My Story

**If you are looking for my resume, please email me or use my Linkedin Profile.**

I wish everyone did a kind of history for their careers instead, so here's mine:

* Moved to Austin, TX!  I picked Security Products team out of three options in Austin, TX.  I left behind my whole world in Bellevue/Seattle for sunnier skies and a chance to work in Security on a cool internal product that was one of my favorite internal tools at Amazon.

* Moved to Outbound Communications Team so I could work alongside data scientists doing ML.  I thought ML was so cool I had to learn more.

* Moved to Flex Account Management Team for the opportunity.  Always wanted to work in Transportation/Logistics/Operations at Amazon, but that sounded way over my head until now!

* Moved to AWS WorkSpaces Client Team in the newly opened Bellevue office to cut down the commute.

* Moved to Ship to Store team within Sports/Outdoors/Toys joining some fantastic people I worked with in Prime Delivery Experience.

* Started working at Amazon.  Started with my choice of overall division of Amazon that existed at the time.  Picked Retail because I love shopping and shopping online, then within Retail, picked Prime over some subsidiary and global website options.  Ended up on Prime Delivery Experience team.

* Worked on a startup during the Summer as the only engineer ( - met them at an Entrepreneurship Pitch Meeting in the UNC CS dept). I quit after only a couple weeks. I learned a lot about what I needed to learn.  I did a few hackathons in college, but I wasn't as passionate about those projects as I was this.

* Applied to a lot of places for entry-level full-time Developer positions.  Got Xerox and Amazon.  Picked Amazon.

* Didn't get the full time offer from that.  I did get a scholarship from them, though, and the money helped me a lot my senior year.

* Re-interviewed for SDE Intern out of my choice of PM/Test/SDE Internship for the next summer and got the internship.

* Dropped off my resume with Microsoft at a career fair and their tech talk.  Got the Explore Microsoft Internship.

* My older brother said over secret Thanksgiving pizza (not a conspiracy! Our grandma just underestimated how much we eat since we weren't 8 years old anymore, Bless her heart) to take as many Computer Science classes as possible as a backup plan - better yet major in it.  Got back to college and changed my major.

* Went to UNC Chapel Hill not locking in that I wanted to be a Software Engineer just yet.

* Took my first programming class in Junior year of High school and my second programming class in Senior year of High school.  I placed in the high performing group in my second programming class.  The class of about 30 was split up into 3 groups.  Group 1 was high performing and helped Group 3 that was struggling.  Group 2 continued the assignments at the regular pace.
